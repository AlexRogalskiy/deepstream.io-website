# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in the deepstream.io open source server ("deepstream.io"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, deepstream.io must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of deepstream.io and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You can readup on the importance of CLAs from some great articles on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement
and Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/.
