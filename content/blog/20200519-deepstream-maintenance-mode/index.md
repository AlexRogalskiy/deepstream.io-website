I have some sad news to share today. After joining deepstream around 5 years ago I'm stepping down as the active core maintainer. Given there hasn't been any other core contributors for the last couple of years this means deepstream as a project will be purely reliant on community activity to stay up to date and for bug fixes.

The reason why I decided to make this statement instead of just quietly stopping my involvement is because adopting core stack technology is an expensive and difficult process, and I would rather have potential adopters have a clear indication about the current state of the project when making that decision. I have spent the last few months gathering information, mainly via trying to [assess the usage of this project in the wider world](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/1049) and [contribution callouts](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/1030), both with very limited results.

I will still be merging in PRs and doing releases, however I will no longer be active within the communication channels or github issues, fixing bugs or answering questions. Will contain my activity to just making sure fixes can find their way in while the deepstream community figures out how to move forward.

If your interested in owning part of this project please let me know via github.

Contributors willing to do the following will help this project progress forward:

- Improve documentation. Either adding guides, tutorials or fixing issues.
- Improve the website itself. It's in react and gatsby.
- Own and improve connectors and plugins. They are minimal in code but keeping track of dependencies and testing against latest versions of the database and caches is required for security and to remain relevant.
- SDKs
- Custom plugins
- Most importantly, [stating your using deepstream](https://forms.gle/8mtPrGe1y5q3KweR7). The more users we can publicly say we have the more likely people will contribute.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank everyone for their time and effort adopting deepstream, and for the huge support we had during our deepstreamHub era. This was quite the journey, and I really hope to see realtime techs boundries push on going forwards.
