I have some sad news to share today. After joining deepstream around 5 years ago I'm stepping down as the core maintainer. Unfortunately given there hasn't been any other core contributors for the last couple of years this means deepstream as a project itself will be shutting down.

The reason why I decided to make this statement instead of just quietly stopping my involvement is because adopting core stack technology is an expensive and difficult process, and I would rather have potential adopters have a clear indication about the current state of the project when making that decision. I have spent the last few months gathering information to make this decision, mainly via trying to [assess the usage of this project in the wider world](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/1049) and [contribution callouts](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/1030), both with very limited results.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank everyone for their time and effort adopting deepstream, and for the huge support we had during our deepstreamHub era. This was quite the journey, and I really hope to see realtime techs boundries push on going forwards.
