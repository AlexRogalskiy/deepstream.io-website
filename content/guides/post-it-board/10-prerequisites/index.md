In order to build this application we are going to go as bare bone minimum as possible. What this means is we just be be using good old [jQuery](//jquery.com/) and deepstream.

To achieve this we need a really basic HTML page that:

- includes both jQuery and deepstream from CDNs
- has a login-form
- has a board
- has three post-its (sad, happy, mad)
