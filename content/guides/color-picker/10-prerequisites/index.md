In order to build this application we are going to go as bare bone minimum as possible. What this means is we just be be using good old [jQuery](//jquery.com/), deepstream and a single HTML file.

To achieve this we need a really basic HTML page that imports both jQuery and deepstream from a CDN, provides the basic HTML/CSS for visuals and is just missing the javascript ot get it all working.

To do so, copy the following HTML into a file with a HTML extension, and just open it in any browser to see a basic form show up.
