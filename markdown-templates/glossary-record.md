[[glossary]]
| *Records* are the documents in deepstreamHubâ€™s realtime datastore. A record is identified by a [unique id](/docs/client-js/client/#getuid-) and can contain any kind of JSON data. Clients and backend processes can create, read, write, update and observe the entire record as well as paths within it. Any change is immediately synchronized amongst all connected subscribers.
| Records can be arranged in [lists](/docs/client-js/datasync-list/) and collections and can contain references to other records to allow for the modelling of relational data structures.
| You can learn more about records in the [records tutorial](/docs/client-js/datasync-record/).
