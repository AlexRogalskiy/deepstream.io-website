Apps with a focus on collaboration need to be able to sync changes between large numbers of clients, financial platforms must fan out prices with ultra-low latency and apps with a focus on communication require comparable up- and down-stream times.</p>\n<p>To ensure deepstream can cater for all these use cases, we are regularly conducting performance tests and benchmarks.</p>\n<p>In doing so, we have three main goals. We want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>quantify deepstream’s performance to help choose the right hardware and deployment strategy</li>\n<li>develop a suite of benchmarks that create reproducible results to help detect any decline in performance early on</li>\n<li>make it easier to compare deepstream against other realtime servers to help you choose the right tool for your performance requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: The following tests are non-conclusive and will be improved and extended as development progresses.
