It’s also a node server than can be easily extended with custom logic in almost all cases.</p>\n<p>Clients establish persistent, bidirectional WebSocket connections with the deepstream server using lightweight SDKs that are available for <a href=\"/tutorials/guides/getting-started-quickstart/#getting-the-client\">Browsers/Node</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/72\">Java/Android</a> and soon/partially as well for <a href=\"https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/68\">iOS(ObjC/Swift)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/72\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/70\">.NET</a> and <a href=\"/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/issues/69\">C/C++</a>.</p>\n<p>The server itself is <a href=\"/docs/server/configuration/\">configurable</a> and uses <a href=\"/tutorials/core/permission/conf-simple/\">permission files</a> to validate incoming messages, but doesn’t hold any custom logic other than that. All logic is provided by “clients” which can be backend processes as well as end-users. deepstream provides numerous features such as <a href=\"/tutorials/core/active-data-providers/\">listening and active subscriptions</a> to hook into what users request and provide/transform data accordingly as well as integrate and retrieve data from third party components or APIs.\nThis makes deepstream useful as both a realtime server for mobile/browser and desktop clients as well as a backbone for microservice architectures.</p>\n<p>What is it for?</p>\n<p>deepstream is useful as a backend for most applications, but is mostly used for</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaboration apps like Google Docs or Trello</li>\n<li>Fast trading, gambling or auction platforms</li>\n<li>Messengers and social interaction</li>\n<li>Financial reporting and risk control</li>\n<li>Casual and Mobile multiplayer games</li>\n<li>Realtime dashboards and analytic systems</li>\n<li>IoT metric gathering and control</li>\n<li>Stock / Inventory control</li>\n<li>Process management systems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-it-do\"><a href=\"#what-does-it-do\" aria-label=\"what does it do permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What does it do?</h3>\n<p>deepstream provides three core concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/tutorials/core/datasync/records/\">Data-sync:</a></strong> stateful and persistent JSON objects that can be manipulated in whole or in parts and are synchronized across all connected clients</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/tutorials/core/pubsub/\">Pub-Sub:</a></strong> many-to-many messaging based on subscriptions to topics</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/tutorials/core/request-response/\">Request-Response:</a></strong> Question/Answer workflows</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/tutorials/core/presence/\">Presence:</a></strong> Question/Answer workflows</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-it-not-do\"><a href=\"#what-does-it-not-do\" aria-label=\"what does it not do permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What does it not do?</h3>\n<p>deepstream is a realtime data server that can handle all aspects of your application’s logic. But: </p>\n<p>It is not an HTTP server, so won’t be able to serve images, HTML or CSS files. When you’re building a webapp we recommend using a CDN and something like Github pages or AWS S3 to serve your static assets and leave the dynamic data to deepstream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-can-it-be-compared-to\"><a href=\"#what-can-it-be-compared-to\" aria-label=\"what can it be compared to permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What can it be compared to?</h3>\n<p>The most frequent comparison is a “self hosted Firebase”. That’s quite close although deepstream also offers pub/sub and request/response and breaks its data down into small objects called “records” with individual life cycles, rather than Firebase’s monolithic single tree structure. This makes it conceptually closer to the way financial trading or multiplayer game servers are built - as well as magnitudes faster.
