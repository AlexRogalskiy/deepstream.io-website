In fact, so many that its often referred to as the &quot;Swiss Army Knife of the web&quot;. Redis is first and foremost a cache. It&apos;s fast, simple, single threaded with non-blocking I/O and scales well in distributed deployments (should sound familiar to deepstream fans).</p>\n<p>But it also persists its data to disk, making it a good alternative to full-size databases for simpler usecases and can act as a publish/subscribe server for message distribution.</p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 513px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 38.40155945419104%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Redis\" title src=\"/static/1991df597267d70bf9066a7d11969da0/e5f70/redis.png\" srcset=\"/static/1991df597267d70bf9066a7d11969da0/6a467/redis.png 210w,\n/static/1991df597267d70bf9066a7d11969da0/635b1/redis.png 420w,\n/static/1991df597267d70bf9066a7d11969da0/e5f70/redis.png 513w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>You can easily install Redis yourself or use it as a service from your cloud hosting provider, e.g. via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\">AWS ElastiCache</a>, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/\">Microsoft Azure</a> or <a href=\"http://objectrocket.com/\">RackSpace&apos;s Object Rocket</a>. Due to its popularity there are also a number of specialized Redis hosting companies, e.g. <a href=\"https://redislabs.com/\">RedisLabs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redisgreen.net/\">RedisGreen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.compose.io/\">Compose</a> or <a href=\"https://scalegrid.io/\">ScaleGrid</a>, but be careful: deepstream constantly interacts with its cache, so every millisecond network latency between its server and your RedisHoster makes deepstream notably slower. We strongly recommend choosing a cache that runs in close network proximity to your deepstream servers, e.g. within the same data-center.</p>\n<h4>Why use Redis with deepstream?</h4>\n<p>Redis is a great fit for use with deepstream. It can be used as a cache, persists data and re-distributes messages for smaller to medium sized deepstream clusters. It won&apos;t be much help when it comes to executing complex queries, but if you can live without, Redis might be all you need for your production deployment.</p>\n</div></p>\n<h4 id=\"how-to-use-redis-as-a-cache-with-deepstream\"><a href=\"#how-to-use-redis-as-a-cache-with-deepstream\" aria-label=\"how to use redis as a cache with deepstream permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to use Redis as a cache with deepstream?</h4>\n<p>It comes preinstalled with the binary or if youâ€™re using deepstream in Node.js via <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepstream/cache-redis\">NPM</a></p>\n<p>And can be enabled in your config file as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">cache</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> redis\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">options</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">host</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> localhost\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">port</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">6379</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Both connectors work with Redis clusters as well.
