This is known as a “full mesh network topology”.</p>\n<p>The benefits of full mesh networks are their decentralised state and their relative simplicity. The huge downside however is their lack of scalability - with every additional client the total number of connections grows by n - 1. Likewise, every message has to be send to every client individually causing substantial bandwith overheads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-network-topologies\"><a href=\"#other-network-topologies\" aria-label=\"other network topologies permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Other Network topologies</h3>\n<p>Full-Mesh networks are not the only way to create decentralized peer-to-peer topologies.

You can learn more about this in the <a href=\"/tutorials/webrtc//webrtc-in-production/\">final part of this tutorial</a> where we talk about selective forwarding units, bridges, multicasting and other bits and bobs that are required to make WebRTC work in the real world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-down-to-code\"><a href=\"#getting-down-to-code\" aria-label=\"getting down to code permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting down to code</h2>\n<p>For this tutorial, we’ll look into creating a Full Mesh between connected clients.
