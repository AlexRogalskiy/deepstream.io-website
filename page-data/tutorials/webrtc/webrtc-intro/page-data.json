As far as browser APIs go its very low level and leaves many aspects of connection establishment and upkeep to the developer.\nAnd once you’ve got your first videochat working you’ll realise something else: it’s incredibly hard! Using WebRTC for realworld apps such as <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\">Google Hangouts</a> requires a host of server side infrastructure that processes, aggregates and forwards data, manages state and connectivity and provides smoothing for the hundreds of edge cases that continue to exists around peer-to-peer video and audio streaming.</p>\n<p>This shouldn’t discourage you though. Depending on your requirements WebRTC might not only be the fastest solution, but simply the only choice. And it might help you save lots of money by keeping data-heavy traffic of your servers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"where-does-this-guide-fit-in\"><a href=\"#where-does-this-guide-fit-in\" aria-label=\"where does this guide fit in permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where does this guide fit in?</h4>\n<p>This guide will take you through the basics of setting up WebRTC data, voice and video channels between two peers as well as whole rooms of users, sending files, manipulating video or sharing your screen.

Well, yes - it is. But these peers need to  find each other. The problem is that your browser only has an ant’s view of its own location. Imagine asking your friend for her address and she replies with “I’m in the red house”. Great - but now you’ll need to figure out which street this house is in, which city the street is in and so on - and once you’ve got all this information together and made it to her house you’ll still need to try a couple of doors and windows to find one that lets you in.</p>\n<p>This process is called “Interactive Connectivity Establishment” or ICE for short and it involves an external server that transmits SDP signals between the peers as well as possibly an additional STUN or TURN server to overcome a NATS.
