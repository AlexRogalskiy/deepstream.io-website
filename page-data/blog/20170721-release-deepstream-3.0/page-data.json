It comes with its own set of features. Amongst the most popular ones: our HTTP API.</p>\n<p>The API makes it possible for any programming language to create, read, write and delete records, send events or make RPCs. This opened up a whole new range of usecases: sending events from AWS Lambda functions, bulk importing thousands of records at once, making AJAX calls without establishing a deepstream connection — to name just a few.</p>\n<p>With deepstream 3.0 this API will come back to open source. But we didn’t just take some code from the hub and put it into the open source server — we want to go further:</p>\n<p>deepstream 3.0 will come with a re-architected abstract connection endpoint, making it possible to add any number of communication mechanisms and protocols to exchange data and interact with deepstream’s records, events and RPCs:</p>\n<p>GraphQL, MQTT, STOMP, Binary transports…just a few of the things on the horizon…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Release: Deepstream 3.0","description":"a foundation for a multi-protocol-server"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/20170721-release-deepstream-3.0/","githubLink":"https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-website/blob/master/content/blog/20170721-release-deepstream-3.0/index.md","weightedSlug":"/blog/20170721-release-deepstream-3.0/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/20170721-release-deepstream-3.0/","navigation":{"order":100,"release-deepstream-2.3":{"slug":"/blog/20170509-release-deepstream-2.3/","title":"Release: Deepstream 2.3","description":"Announcing the 2.3 release of deepstream.io and all the associated goodies","leaf":true,"order":20170509,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-2.4":{"slug":"/blog/20170702-release-deepstream-2.4/","title":"Release: Deepstream 2.4","description":"Announcing the 2.4 release of deepstream.io","leaf":true,"order":20170702,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-3.0":{"slug":"/blog/20170721-release-deepstream-3.0/","title":"Release: Deepstream 3.0","description":"a foundation for a multi-protocol-server","leaf":true,"order":20170721,"":{"order":100}},"release-clientjs-4.0":{"slug":"/blog/20190730-release-clientjs-4.0/","title":"Release: Javascript/Node 4.0","description":"The newly improved Typescript and ES6 SDK","leaf":true,"order":20190730,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-4.1":{"slug":"/blog/20190830-release-deepstream-4.1/","title":"Release: Deepstream 4.1","description":"Deepstream V3 and below compatibility support!","leaf":true,"order":20190830,"":{"order":100}},"release-clientjs-4.1":{"slug":"/blog/20190905-release-clientjs-4.1/","title":"Release: Javascript/Node 4.1","description":"Default Timer Implementation","leaf":true,"order":20190905,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-4.2":{"slug":"/blog/20190909-release-deepstream-4.2/","title":"Release: Deepstream 4.2","description":"MQTT AND JSON Protocol support!","leaf":true,"order":20190909,"":{"order":100}},"release-clientjs-5.0":{"slug":"/blog/20190920-release-clientjs-5.0/","title":"Release: Javascript/Node 5.0","description":"Better Typescript and MIT","leaf":true,"order":20190920,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-5.0":{"slug":"/blog/20190920-release-deepstream-5.0/","title":"Release: Deepstream 5.0","description":"The MIT Resurrection","leaf":true,"order":20190920,"":{"order":100}},"realtime-search":{"slug":"/blog/20191104-realtime-search/","title":"Realtime Search","description":"The Realtime Search Evolution","leaf":true,"order":20191104,"":{"order":100}},"release-deepstream-4.0":{"slug":"/blog/20190730-release-deepstream-4.0/","title":"Release: Deepstream 4.0","description":"The massively upgraded deepstream server!
