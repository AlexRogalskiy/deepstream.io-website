Therefore, if you are going to keep them waiting, they deserve to know why and how long they will wait. It’s not just in browsers; a lady in a waiting room would have some sense of feedback if she is given a tag and time slot, instead of leaving her there and just asking her to WAIT.</p>\n<p>Spinners provide poor feedback for very long request-response activity. Indefinite progress bars are even worse. What you can do is provide a live progress bar that shows the current status. A situation where you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive a file</li>\n<li>Process the file</li>\n<li>Upload the file</li>\n<li>Save the file name to a database</li>\n<li>Respond with the file information saved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will definitely need to let the user know what is happening behind the scenes so as to give them a good reason to wait. We will not do all that in our example, rather, we will simulate the time it takes to do each of them using <code class=\"language-text\">setTimeout</code>.</p>\n<p>In each of the async functions, you can send realtime updates to the client informing her about what’s ongoing on the server and why she is yet to receive a response.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Live Progress Bar","description":"Learn
